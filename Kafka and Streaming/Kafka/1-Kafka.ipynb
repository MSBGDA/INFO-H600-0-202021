    "### Preliminary note:\n",
    "This notebook assumes that you are running it on the cluster. You can run it on a local machine, but take into account that you need to modify the addresses of zookeeper and the brokers\n",

    "# Kafka\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kafka** is a distributed publish-subscribe message system focused on high throughput. All messages ingested by Kafka are persisted on disk and are also replicated within a given cluster to garantee fault-tolerance and thus prevent data loss. However, Kafka relies on another service, **ZooKeeper** which offers Kafka the synchronisation information it needs to run properly in a distributed way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of Kafka are thus : \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Reliability* as it is distributed, partitioned, replicated and offers fault tolerance.\n",
    "- *Scalability* as we can either increase or descrease the actual size of a Kafka cluster on demand and without downtime to best fit the actual load.\n",
    "- *Durabiliy* as all messages are persisted on disk.\n",
    "- *Performance* as it is designed for High Throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can Kafka be used for ?\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Log aggregation* even though other systems may even be more appropriate for that purpose now.\n",
    "- *Metrics* as it can ingest vasts amounts of data, collecting metrics from multiple servers was a strong point for monitoring system even though, again, other systems do exist now for such scenarios.\n",
    "- *Stream Processing* Now we are talking. Framework like Storm and Spark Streaming can take advantage of Kafka to process information in a streaming fashion thus offering us different means of making data analysis. Indeed, in MapReduce, you only do Batch-Processing, you cannot handle continuous influx of information without having to invest lots of time in automating your submissions were in Spark Streaming for instance, you can make an application run permanently and analysing data as it arrives."

    "# Kafka concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Kafka, you have to be familiar with the concepts it uses such as *topics*, *brokers*, *producers* and *consumers*.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_kafka/images/fundamentals.jpg \"Kafka Architecture with a replication factor of 3\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Topic** A stream of messages belonging to a particular category is called a topic. Data is stored in topics.\n",
    "- **Partition** Topics are split into partitions. For each topic, Kafka keeps a minimum of one partition. Each such partition contains messages in an immutable ordered sequence. **Partition offset ** Each partitioned message has a unique sequence id called as offset.\n",
    "- **Replicas** Replicas are nothing but backups of a partition. They are used to prevent data loss.\n",
    "- **Broker** Brokers are worker processes that are responsible for maintaining the published data (accespting data form produces, serving it to consumers). Each broker may have zero or more partitions per topic. \n",
    "- **Kafka cluster** The set of all Kafka brokers. A Kafka cluster can be expanded without downtime. These clusters are used to manage the persistence and replication of message data.\n",
    "- **Producers** are Publishers of messages\n",
    "- **Consumers** are Consumers of messages\n",
    "- **Leader** Node responsible for all reads and write for a given partition, thus, each partition has one broker acting as leader.\n",
    "- **Follower** Node which just follows the **Leader** instructions. A Follower may become a Leader if the node attributed the role of Leader fails at some point. In practise, a Follower acts just as a consumer, consuming data from its Leader to maintain its own data store.\n",
    "- **ZooKeeper** ZooKeeper is used for managing and coordinating Kafka broker. ZooKeeper service is mainly used to notify producer and consumer about the presence of any new broker in the Kafka system or failure of the broker in the Kafka system. As per the notification received by the Zookeeper regarding presence or failure of the broker then pro-ducer and consumer takes decision and starts coordinating their task with some other broker.\n"

      "There is abundant evidence of a widened and deepened interest in modern\r\n",

      "the eventfulness of recent advances?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the interest of the general public would be even greater than it is\r\n",
      "if the makers of new knowledge were more willing to expound their\r\n",
      "discoveries in ways that could be \"understanded of the people.\" No one\r\n",
      "objects very much to technicalities in a game or on board a yacht, and\r\n",
      "they are clearly necessary for terse and precise scientific description.\r\n",
      "It is certain, however, that they can be reduced to a minimum without\r\n",
      "sacrificing accuracy, when the object in view is to explain \"the gist of\r\n",
      "the matter.\" So this OUTLINE OF SCIENCE is meant for the general reader,\r\n",
      "who lacks both time and opportunity for special study, and yet would\r\n",
      "take an intelligent interest in the progress of science which is making\r\n",
      "the world always new.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story of the triumphs of modern science is one of which Man may well\r\n",
      "be proud. Science reads the secret of the distant star and anatomises\r\n",
      "the atom; foretells the date of the comet's return and predicts the\r\n",
      "kinds of chickens that will hatch from a dozen eggs; discovers the laws\r\n",
      "of the wind that bloweth where it listeth and reduces to order the\r\n",
      "disorder of disease. Science is always setting forth on Columbus\r\n",
      "voyages, discovering new worlds and conquering them by understanding.\r\n",
      "For Knowledge means Foresight and Foresight means Power.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The idea of Evolution has influenced all the sciences, forcing us to\r\n",
      "think of _everything_ as with a history behind it, for we have travelled\r\n",
      "far since Darwin's day. The solar system, the earth, the mountain\r\n",
      "ranges, and the great deeps, the rocks and crystals, the plants and\r\n",
      "animals, man himself and his social institutions--all must be seen as\r\n",
      "the outcome of a long process of Becoming. There are some eighty-odd\r\n",
      "chemical elements on the earth to-day, and it is now much more than a\r\n",
      "suggestion that these are the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element\r\n",
      "giving rise to element, going back and back to some primeval stuff, from\r\n",
      "which they were all originally derived, infinitely long ago. No idea has\r\n",
      "been so powerful a tool in the fashioning of New Knowledge as this\r\n",
      "simple but profound idea of Evolution, that the present is the child of\r\n",
      "the past and the parent of the future. And with the picture of a\r\n",
      "continuity of evolution from nebula to social systems comes a promise of\r\n",
      "an increasing control--a promise that Man will become not only a more\r\n",
      "accurate student, but a more complete master of his world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is characteristic of modern science that the whole world is seen to\r\n",
      "be more vital than before. Everywhere there has been a passage from the\r\n",
      "static to the dynamic. Thus the new revelations of the constitution of\r\n",
      "matter, which we owe to the discoveries of men like Professor Sir J. J.\r\n",
      "Thomson, Professor Sir Ernest Rutherford, and Professor Frederick Soddy,\r\n",
      "have shown the very dust to have a complexity and an activity heretofore\r\n",
      "unimagined. Such phrases as \"dead\" matter and \"inert\" matter have gone\r\n",
      "by the board.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The new theory of the atom amounts almost to a new conception of the\r\n",
      "universe. It bids fair to reveal to us many of nature's hidden secrets.\r\n",
      "The atom is no longer the indivisible particle of matter it was once\r\n",
      "understood to be. We know now that there is an atom within the\r\n",
      "atom--that what we thought was elementary can be dissociated and broken\r\n",
      "up. The present-day theories of the atom and the constitution of matter\r\n",
      "are the outcome of the comparatively recent discovery of such things as\r\n",
      "radium, the X-rays, and the wonderful revelations of such instruments as\r\n",
      "the spectroscope and other highly perfected scientific instruments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The advent of the electron theory has thrown a flood of light on what\r\n",
      "before was hidden or only dimly guessed at. It has given us a new\r\n",
      "conception of the framework of the universe. We are beginning to know\r\n",
      "and realise of what matter is made and what electric phenomena mean. We\r\n",
      "can glimpse the vast stores of energy locked up in matter. The new\r\n",
      "knowledge has much to tell us about the origin and phenomena, not only\r\n",
      "of our own planet, but other planets, of the stars, and the sun. New\r\n",
      "light is thrown on the source of the sun's heat; we can make more than\r\n",
      "guesses as to its probable age. The great question to-day is: is there\r\n",
      "_one_ primordial substance from which all the varying forms of matter\r\n",
      "have been evolved?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the discovery of electrons is only one of the revolutionary changes\r\n",
      "which give modern science an entrancing interest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As in chemistry and physics, so in the science of living creatures there\r\n",
      "have been recent advances that have changed the whole prospect. A good\r\n",
      "instance is afforded by the discovery of the \"hormones,\" or chemical\r\n",
      "messengers, which are produced by ductless glands, such as the thyroid,\r\n",
      "the supra-renal, and the pituitary, and are distributed throughout the\r\n",
      "body by the blood. The work of physiologists like Professor Starling and\r\n",
      "Professor Bayliss has shown that these chemical messengers regulate what\r\n",
      "may be called the \"pace\" of the body, and bring about that regulated\r\n",
      "harmony and smoothness of working which we know as health. It is not too\r\n",
      "much to say that the discovery of hormones has changed the whole of\r\n",
      "physiology. Our knowledge of the human body far surpasses that of the\r\n",
      "past generation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The persistent patience of microscopists and technical improvements like\r\n",
      "the \"ultramicroscope\" have greatly increased our knowledge of the\r\n",
      "invisible world of life. To the bacteria of a past generation have been\r\n",
      "added a multitude of microscopic _animal_ microbes, such as that which\r\n",
      "causes Sleeping Sickness. The life-histories and the weird ways of many\r\n",
      "important parasites have been unravelled; and here again knowledge means\r\n",
      "mastery. To a degree which has almost surpassed expectations there has\r\n",
      "been a revelation of the intricacy of the stones and mortar of the house\r\n",
      "of life, and the microscopic study of germ-cells has wonderfully\r\n",
      "supplemented the epoch-making experimental study of heredity which began\r\n",
      "with Mendel. It goes without saying that no one can call himself\r\n",

      "and mammals. We no longer deny a degree of intelligence to some members\r\n",

      "early instruments have only an historic interest: the era of modern\r\n",
      "telescopes begins in the nineteenth century.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During the last century telescope construction underwent an\r\n",
      "unprecedented development. An immense amount of interest was taken in\r\n",
      "the construction of large telescopes, and the different countries of the\r\n",
      "world entered on an exciting race to produce the most powerful possible\r\n",
      "instruments. Besides this rivalry of different countries there was a\r\n",
      "rivalry of methods. The telescope developed along two different lines,\r\n",
      "and each of these two types has its partisans at the present day. These\r\n",
      "types are known as _refractors_ and _reflectors_, and it is necessary to\r\n",
      "mention, briefly, the principles employed in each. The _refractor_ is\r\n",
      "the ordinary, familiar type of telescope. It consists, essentially, of a\r\n",
      "large lens at one end of a tube, and a small lens, called the eye-piece,\r\n",
      "at the other. The function of the large lens is to act as a sort of\r\n",
      "gigantic eye. It collects a large amount of light, an amount\r\n",
      "proportional to its size, and brings this light to a focus within the\r\n",
      "tube of the telescope. It thus produces a small but bright image, and\r\n",
      "the eye-piece magnifies this image. In the _reflector_, instead of a\r\n",
      "large lens at the top of the tube, a large mirror is placed at the\r\n",
      "bottom. This mirror is so shaped as to reflect the light that falls on\r\n",
      "it to a focus, whence the light is again led to an eye-piece. Thus the\r\n",
      "refractor and the reflector differ chiefly in their manner of gathering\r\n",
      "light. The powerfulness of the telescope depends on the size of the\r\n",
      "light-gatherer. A telescope with a lens four inches in diameter is four\r\n",
      "times as powerful as the one with a lens two inches in diameter, for the\r\n",
      "amount of light gathered obviously depends on the _area_ of the lens,\r\n",
      "and the area varies as the _square_ of the diameter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The largest telescopes at present in existence are _reflectors_. It is\r\n",
      "much easier to construct a very large mirror than to construct a very\r\n",
      "large lens; it is also cheaper. A mirror is more likely to get out of\r\n",
      "order than is a lens, however, and any irregularity in the shape of a\r\n",
      "mirror produces a greater distorting effect than in a lens. A refractor\r\n",
      "is also more convenient to handle than is a reflector. For these reasons\r\n",
      "great refractors are still made, but the largest of them, the great\r\n",
      "Yerkes' refractor, is much smaller than the greatest reflector, the one\r\n",
      "on Mount Wilson, California. The lens of the Yerkes' refractor measures\r\n",

      "sudden and extreme changes in their surroundings. (_b_) When an animal\r\n",
      "enters a new habitat, or comes into new associations with other\r\n",
      "organisms, it may be invaded by a microbe or by some larger parasite to\r\n",
      "which it is unaccustomed and to which it can offer no resistance. With\r\n",
      "many parasites a \"live-and-let-live\" compromise is arrived at, but new\r\n",
      "parasites are apt to be fatal, as man knows to his cost when he is\r\n",
      "bitten by a tse-tse fly which infects him with the microscopic animal (a\r\n",
      "Trypanosome) that causes Sleeping Sickness. In many animals the\r\n",
      "parasites are not troublesome as long as the host is vigorous, but if\r\n",
      "the host is out of condition the parasites may get the upper hand, as in\r\n",
      "the so-called \"grouse disease,\" and become fatal. (_c_) But besides\r\n",
      "violent death and microbic (or parasitic) death, there is natural death.\r\n",
      "This is in great part to be regarded as the price paid for a body. A\r\n",
      "body worth having implies complexity or division of labour, and this\r\n",
      "implies certain internal furnishings of a more or less stable kind in\r\n",
      "which the effects of wear and tear are apt to accumulate. It is not the\r\n",
      "living matter itself that grows old so much as the framework in which it\r\n",

      "they lie; they will do this within limits in experimental conditions\r\n",
      "when they are placed on a quite artificial floor. As these fishes are\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In these self-effacing flat-fishes we know with some precision what\r\n",

      "size, shape, and position of mobile pigment-cells (chromatophores) and\r\n",
      "the skin. But what makes the pigment-cells change? The fact that a blind\r\n",
      "flat-fish does not change its colour gives us the first part of the\r\n",
      "answer. The colour and the pattern of the surroundings must affect the\r\n",
      "eye. The message travels by the optic nerve to the brain; from the\r\n",
      "brain, instead of passing down the spinal cord, the message travels down\r\n",
      "the chain of sympathetic ganglia. From these it passes along the nerves\r\n",

      "The same power of rapid colour-change is seen in cuttlefishes, where it\r\n",
      "is often an expression of nervous excitement, though it sometimes helps\r\n",
      "to conceal. It occurs with much subtlety in the Æsop prawn, Hippolyte,\r\n",
      "which may be brown on a brown seaweed, green on sea-lettuce or\r\n",

      "readily seen. In other circumstances, however, they do not practise\r\n",
      "self-effacement, but the very reverse. They inflate their bodies, having\r\n",
      "not only large lungs, but air-sacs in connection with them. The throat\r\n",
      "bulges; the body sways from side to side; and the creature expresses its\r\n",
      "sentiments in a hiss. The power of colour-change is very remarkable, and\r\n",
      "depends partly on the contraction and expansion of the colour-cells\r\n",

      "is so sensitive that a passing cloud makes it change its emerald hue.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is no doubt that a chameleon may make itself more inconspicuous by\r\n",
      "changing its colour, being affected by the play of light on its eyes. A\r\n",
      "bright-green hue is often seen on those that are sitting among strongly\r\n",
      "illumined green leaves. But the colour also changes with the time of day\r\n",
      "and with the animal's moods. A sudden irritation may bring about a rapid\r\n",
      "change; in other cases the transformation comes about very gradually.\r\n",
      "When the colour-change expresses the chameleon's feelings it might be\r\n",
      "compared to blushing, but that is due to an expansion of the arteries of\r\n",
      "the face, allowing more blood to get into the capillaries of the\r\n",
      "under-skin. The case of the chameleon is peculiarly interesting because\r\n",
      "the animal has two kinds of tactics--self-effacement on the one hand and\r\n",

      "Interpretation of the Salmon's Story\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When an animal frequents two different haunts, in one of which it\r\n",
      "breeds, it is very often safe to say that the breeding-place represents\r\n",
      "the original home. The flounder is quite comfortable far up the rivers,\r\n",
      "but it has to go to the shore-waters to spawn, and there is no doubt\r\n",
      "that the flounder is a marine fish which has recently learned to\r\n",
      "colonise the fresh waters. Its relatives, like plaice and sole, are\r\n",
      "strictly marine. But it is impossible to make a dogma of the rule that\r\n",
      "the breeding-place corresponds to the original home. Thus some kinds of\r\n",
      "bass, which belong to the marine family of sea-perches, live in the sea\r\n",
      "or in estuaries, while two have become permanent residents in fresh\r\n",
      "water. Or, again, the members of the herring family are very\r\n",
      "distinctively marine, but the shad, which belong to this family, spawn\r\n",
      "in rivers and may spend their lives there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So there are two different ways of interpreting the life-history of the\r\n",
      "salmon. Some authorities regard the salmon as a marine fish which is\r\n",
      "establishing itself in fresh water. But others read the story the other\r\n",
      "way and regard the salmon as a member of a freshwater race, that has\r\n",
      "taken to the sea for feeding purposes. In regard to trout, we know that\r\n",
      "the ranks of those in rivers and lakes are continually being reinforced\r\n",
      "by migrants from the sea, and that some trout go down to the sea while\r\n",
      "others remain in the freshwater. We know also in regard to a related\r\n",
      "fish, the char, that while the great majority of kinds are now permanent\r\n",
      "residents in cold and deep, isolated northern lakes, there are Arctic\r\n",
      "forms which live in the sea but enter the rivers to spawn. These facts\r\n",
      "favour the view that the salmon was originally a marine fish. But there\r\n",
      "are arguments on both sides, and, for our present purpose, the important\r\n",
      "fact is that the salmon is conquering _two_ haunts. Its evolution is\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Early in summer, at dates varying with the distance of the rivers from\r\n",
      "the open Atlantic, crowds of young eels or elvers come up-stream.\r\n",
      "Sometimes the procession or eel-fare includes thousands of individuals,\r\n",
      "each about the length of our first finger, and as thick as a stout\r\n",
      "knitting needle. They obey an inborn impulse to swim against the stream,\r\n",
      "seeking automatically to have both sides of their body equally\r\n",
      "stimulated by the current. So they go straight ahead. The obligation\r\n",
      "works only during the day, for when the sun goes down behind the hills\r\n",
      "the elvers snuggle under stones or beneath the bank and rest till dawn.\r\n",
      "In the course of time they reach the quiet upper reaches of the river or\r\n",
      "go up rivulets and drainpipes to the isolated ponds. Their impulse to go\r\n",
      "on must be very imperious, for they may wriggle up the wet moss by the\r\n",
      "side of a waterfall or even make a short excursion in a damp meadow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the quiet-flowing stretches of the river or in the ponds they feed\r\n",
      "and grow for years and years. They account for a good many young fishes.\r\n",
      "Eventually, after five or six years in the case of the males, six to\r\n",
      "eight years in the case of the females, the well-grown fishes, perhaps a\r\n",
      "foot and a half to two feet long, are seized by a novel restlessness.\r\n",
      "They are beginning to be mature. They put on a silvery jacket and become\r\n",
      "large of eye, and they return to the sea. In getting away from the pond\r\n",
      "it may be necessary to wriggle through the damp meadow-grass before\r\n",
      "reaching the river. They travel by night and rather excitedly. The\r\n",
      "Arctic Ocean is too cold for them and the North Sea too shallow. They\r\n",
      "must go far out to sea, to where the old margin of the once larger\r\n",
      "continent of Europe slopes down to the great abysses, from the Hebrides\r\n",
      "southwards. Eels seem to spawn in the deep dark water; but the just\r\n",
      "liberated eggs have not yet been found. The young fry rises to near the\r\n",
      "surface and becomes a knife-blade-like larva, transparent all but its\r\n",
      "eye. It lives for many months in this state, growing to be about three\r\n",
      "inches long, rising and sinking in the water, and swimming gently.\r\n",
      "These open-sea young eels are known as Leptocephali, a name given to\r\n",
      "them before their real nature was proved. They gradually become shorter,\r\n",
      "and the shape changes from knife-blade-like to cylindrical. During this\r\n",
      "change they fast, and the weight of their delicate body decreases. They\r\n",
      "turn into glass-eels, about 2-1/2 inches long, like a knitting-needle in\r\n",
      "girth. They begin to move towards the distant shores and rivers, and\r\n",
      "they may be a year and a half old before they reach their destination\r\n",
      "and go up-stream as elvers. Those that ascend the rivers of the Eastern\r\n",
      "Baltic must have journeyed three thousand miles. It is certain that no\r\n",

      "that all the young eels ascending the rivers of North Europe have come\r\n",
      "in from the Atlantic, some of them perhaps from the Azores or further\r\n",
      "out still. It is interesting to inquire how the young eels circumvent\r\n",
      "the Falls of the Rhine and get into Lake Constance, or how their kindred\r\n",
      "on the other side of the Atlantic overcome the obstacle of Niagara; but\r\n",
      "it is more important to lay emphasis on the variety of habitats which\r\n",

      "Two Extremes to be Avoided\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The one extreme is that of uncritical generosity which credits every\r\n",
      "animal, like Brer Rabbit--who, by the way, was the hare--with human\r\n",
      "qualities. The other extreme is that of thinking of the animal as if it\r\n",
      "were an automatic machine, in the working of which there is no place or\r\n",
      "use for mind. Both these extremes are to be avoided.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Professor Whitman took the eggs of the Passenger Pigeon (which\r\n",
      "became extinct not long ago with startling rapidity) and placed them a\r\n",
      "few inches to one side of the nest, the bird looked a little uneasy and\r\n",
      "put her beak under her body as if to feel for something that was not\r\n",
      "there. But she did not try to retrieve her eggs, close at hand as they\r\n",
      "were. In a short time she flew away altogether. This shows that the mind\r\n",
      "of the pigeon is in some respects very different from the mind of man.\r\n",
      "On the other hand, when a certain clever dog, carrying a basket of eggs,\r\n",
      "with the handle in his mouth, came to a stile which had to be\r\n",
      "negotiated, he laid the basket on the ground, pushed it gently through a\r\n",
      "low gap to the other side, and then took a running leap over. We dare\r\n",

      "A Caution in Regard to Instinct\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In studying the behaviour of animals, which is the only way of getting\r\n",
      "at their mind, for it is only of our own mind that we have direct\r\n",
      "knowledge, it is essential to give prominence to the fact that there has\r\n",
      "been throughout the evolution of living creatures a strong tendency to\r\n",
      "enregister or engrain capacities of doing things effectively. Thus\r\n",
      "certain abilities come to be inborn; they are parts of the inheritance,\r\n",
      "which will express themselves whenever the appropriate trigger is\r\n",
      "pulled. The newly born child does not require to learn its breathing\r\n",
      "movements, as it afterwards requires to learn its walking movements. The\r\n",
      "ability to go through the breathing movements is inborn, engrained,\r\n",
      "enregistered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In other words, there are hereditary pre-arrangements of nerve-cells and\r\n",
      "muscle-cells which come into activity almost as easily as the beating of\r\n",
      "the heart. In a minute or two the newborn pigling creeps close to its\r\n",
      "mother and sucks milk. It has not to learn how to do this any more than\r\n",
      "we have to learn to cough or sneeze. Thus animals have many useful\r\n",
      "ready-made, or almost ready-made, capacities of doing apparently clever\r\n",
      "things. In simple cases of these inborn pre-arrangements we speak of\r\n",
      "reflex actions; in more complicated cases, of instinctive behaviour. Now\r\n",
      "the caution is this, that while these inborn capacities usually work\r\n",
      "well in natural conditions, they sometimes work badly when the ordinary\r\n",
      "routine is disturbed. We see this when a pigeon continues sitting for\r\n",
      "many days on an empty nest, or when it fails to retrieve its eggs only\r\n",
      "two inches away. But it would be a mistake to call the pigeon, because\r\n",
      "of this, an unutterably stupid bird. We have only to think of the\r\n",
      "achievements of homing pigeons to know that this cannot be true. We must\r\n",
      "not judge animals in regard to those kinds of behaviour which have been\r\n",
      "handed over to instinct, and go badly agee when the normal routine is\r\n",
      "disturbed. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the enregistered\r\n",
      "instinctive capacities work well, and the advantage of their becoming\r\n",
      "stereotyped was to leave the animal more free for adventures at a higher\r\n",
      "level. Being \"a slave of instinct\" may give the animal a security that\r\n",
      "enables it to discover some new home or new food or new joy. Somewhat in\r\n",

      "for moving objects. Except in gristly fishes, the external opening to\r\n",
      "the ear has been lost, so that sound-waves and coarser vibrations must\r\n",
      "influence the inner ear, which is well developed, through the\r\n",
      "surrounding flesh and bones. It seems that the main use of the ear in\r\n",
      "fishes is in connection with balancing, not with hearing. In many cases,\r\n",
      "however, the sense of hearing has been demonstrated; thus fishes will\r\n",
      "come to the side of a pond to be fed when a bell is rung or when a\r\n",
      "whistle is blown by someone not visible from the water. The fact that\r\n",
      "many fishes pay no attention at all to loud noises does not prove that\r\n",
      "they are deaf, for an animal may hear a sound and yet remain quite\r\n",

      "In all three species the male fish makes a nest, in fresh or brackish\r\n",

      "together and fastened by glue-like threads, secreted, strange to say, by\r\n",
      "the kidneys. It is just as if a temporary diseased condition had been\r\n",
      "regularised and turned to good purpose. Going through the nest several\r\n",
      "times, the male makes a little room in the middle. Partly by coercion\r\n",
      "and partly by coaxing he induces a female--first one and then\r\n",
      "another--to pass through the nest with two doors, depositing eggs during\r\n",

      "After the fishes had become quite at home in their artificial\r\n",
      "surroundings, their lessons began. Cloth packets, one of which contained\r\n",
      "meat and the other cotton, were suspended at opposite ends of the\r\n",

      "at once. Those that went towards the packet containing meat darted\r\n",
      "furiously upon it and pulled at it with great excitement. Those that\r\n",
      "went towards the cotton packet turned sharply away when they were within\r\n",
      "about two inches off. They then perceived what those at the other end\r\n",
      "were after and joined them--a common habit amongst fishes. Although the\r\n",
      "minnows were not interested in the tiny \"bags of mystery,\" they were\r\n",

      "species discover their food largely by sense of sight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next set of lessons had to do with colour-associations. The fishes\r\n",
      "were fed on minced snail, chopped earthworm, fragments of liver, and the\r\n",
      "like, and the food was given to them from the end of forceps held above\r\n",
      "the surface of the water, so that the fishes could not be influenced by\r\n",

      "forceps. Discs of coloured cardboard were slipped over the end of the\r\n",
      "forceps, so that what the fishes saw was a morsel of food in the centre\r\n",

      "were so well accustomed to the coloured discs that the presentation of\r\n",
      "one served as a signal for the fishes to dart to the surface and spring\r\n",

      "quickly that it can hardly be overtaken. It hunts vigorously for\r\n",

      "minutes; and after another interval of two hours it only required five\r\n",

      "the path followed was quite direct, and so it was on the fiftieth trip,\r\n",
      "which only required thirty-five seconds. Of course, the whole thing did\r\n",

      "very remarkable results. The negative pole of the electric current (the\r\n",
      "\"cathode\") _gave off rays which faintly lit the molecules of the thin\r\n",
      "gas in the tube_, and caused a pretty fluorescence on the glass walls of\r\n",

      "Now Crookes really had the great secret under his eyes. But about twenty\r\n",
      "years elapsed before the true nature of these rays was finally and\r\n",
      "independently established by various experiments. The experiments proved\r\n",
      "\"that the rays consisted of a stream of negatively charged particles\r\n",
      "travelling with enormous velocities from 10,000 to 100,000 miles a\r\n",

      "Leaving the water for dry land implied a loss in freedom of movement,\r\n",
      "for the terrestrial animal is primarily restricted to the surface of the\r\n",
      "earth. Thus it became essential that movements should be very rapid and\r\n",
      "very precise, needs with which we may associate the acquisition of fine\r\n",
      "cross-striped, quickly contracting muscles, and also, in time, their\r\n",
      "multiplication into very numerous separate engines. We exercise\r\n",
      "fifty-four muscles in the half-second that elapses between raising the\r\n",
      "heel of our foot in walking and planting it firmly on the ground again.\r\n",
      "Moreover, the need for rapid precisely controlled movements implied an\r\n",
      "improved nervous system, for the brain was a movement-controlling organ\r\n",
      "for ages before it did much in the way of thinking. The transition to\r\n",
      "terra firma also involved a greater compactness of body, so that there\r\n",
      "should not be too great friction on the surface. An animal like the\r\n",
      "jellyfish is unthinkable on land, and the elongated bodies of some land\r\n",
      "animals like centipedes and snakes are specially adapted so that they do\r\n",
      "not \"sprawl.\" They are exceptions that prove the rule.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Getting on to dry land meant entering a kingdom where the differences\r\n",
      "between day and night, between summer and winter are more felt than in\r\n",
      "the sea. This made it advantageous to have protections against\r\n",
      "evaporation and loss of heat and other such dangers. Hence a variety of\r\n",
      "ways in which the surface of the body acquired a thickened skin, or a\r\n",
      "dead cuticle, or a shell, or a growth of hair, and so forth. In many\r\n",
      "cases there is an increase of the protection before the winter sets in,\r\n",
      "e.g. by growing thicker fur or by accumulating a layer of fat below the\r\n",
      "skin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the thickening or protection of the skin involved a partial or total\r\n",
      "loss of the skin as a respiratory surface. There is more oxygen\r\n",
      "available on dry land than in the water, but it is not so readily\r\n",
      "captured. Thus we see the importance of moist internal surfaces for\r\n",

      "For every animal one discovers when observing carefully, there must be\r\n",
      "ten unseen. This is partly because many animals burrow in the ground or\r\n",
      "get in underneath things and into dark corners, being what is called\r\n",
      "cryptozoic or elusive. But it is partly because many animals put on\r\n",
      "disguise or have in some way acquired a garment of invisibility. This is\r\n",
      "very common among animals, and it occurs in many forms and degrees. The\r\n",
      "reason why it is so common is because the struggle for existence is\r\n",
      "often very keen, and the reasons why the struggle for existence is keen\r\n",
      "are four. First, there is the tendency to over-population in many\r\n",
      "animals, especially those of low degree. Second, there is the fact that\r\n",
      "the scheme of nature involves nutritive chains or successive\r\n",
      "incarnations, one animal depending upon another for food, and all in the\r\n",
      "long run on plants; thirdly, every vigorous animal is a bit of a\r\n",
      "hustler, given to insurgence and sticking out his elbows. There is a\r\n",
      "fourth great reason for the struggle for existence, namely, the frequent\r\n",
      "changefulness of the physical environment, which forces animals to\r\n",
      "answer back or die; but the first three reasons have most to do with the\r\n",
      "very common assumption of some sort of disguise. Even when an animal is\r\n",
      "in no sense a weakling, it may be very advantageous for it to be\r\n",
      "inconspicuous when it is resting or when it is taking care of its young.\r\n",
      "Our problem is the evolution of elusiveness, so far at least as that\r\n",
      "depends on likeness to surroundings, on protective resemblance to other\r\n",
      "objects, and in its highest reaches on true mimicry.\r\n",

      "Colour Permanently Like That of Surroundings\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Many animals living on sandy places have a light-brown colour, as is\r\n",
      "seen in some lizards and snakes. The green lizard is like the grass and\r\n",
      "the green tree-snake is inconspicuous among the branches. The spotted\r\n",
      "leopard is suited to the interrupted light of the forest, and it is\r\n",
      "sometimes hard to tell where the jungle ends and the striped tiger\r\n",
      "begins. There is no better case than the hare or the partridge sitting a\r\n",
      "few yards off on the ploughed field. Even a donkey grazing in the dusk\r\n",
      "is much more readily heard than seen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The experiment has been made of tethering the green variety of Praying\r\n",
      "Mantis on green herbage, fastening them with silk threads. They escape\r\n",
      "the notice of birds. The same is true when the brown variety is tethered\r\n",
      "on withered herbage. But if the green ones are put on brown plants, or\r\n",
      "the brown ones on green plants, the birds pick them off. Similarly, out\r\n",
      "of 300 chickens in a field, 240 white or black and therefore\r\n",
      "conspicuous, 60 spotted and inconspicuous, 24 were soon picked off by\r\n",
      "crows, but only one of these was spotted. This was not the proportion\r\n",
      "that there should have been if the mortality had been fortuitous. There\r\n",
      "is no doubt that it often pays an animal to be like its habitual\r\n",
      "surroundings, like a little piece of scenery if the animal is not\r\n",
      "moving. It is safe to say that in process of time wide departures from\r\n",
      "the safest coloration will be wiped out in the course of Nature's\r\n",
      "ceaseless sifting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But we must not be credulous, and there are three cautions to be borne\r\n",
      "in mind. (1) An animal may be very like its surroundings without there\r\n",
      "being any protection implied. The arrow-worms in the sea are as clear as\r\n",
      "glass, and so are many open-sea animals. But this is because their\r\n",
      "tissues are so watery, with a specific gravity near that of the salt\r\n",
      "water. And the invisibility does not save them, always or often, from\r\n",
      "being swallowed by larger animals that gather the harvest of the sea.\r\n",
      "(2) Among the cleverer animals it looks as if the creature sometimes\r\n",
      "sought out a spot where it was most inconspicuous. A spider may place\r\n",
      "itself in the middle of a little patch of lichen, where its\r\n",
      "self-effacement is complete. Perhaps it is more comfortable as well as\r\n",
      "safer to rest in surroundings the general colour of which is like that\r\n",
      "of the animal's body. (3) The fishes that live among the coral-reefs are\r\n",
      "startling in their brilliant coloration, and there are many different\r\n",
      "patterns. To explain this it has been suggested that these fishes are so\r\n",
      "safe among the mazy passages and endless nooks of the reefs, that they\r\n",
      "can well afford to wear any colour that suits their constitution. In\r\n",
      "some cases this may be true, but naturalists who have put on a diving\r\n",
      "suit and walked about among the coral have told us that each kind of\r\n",
      "fish is particularly suited to some particular place, and that some are\r\n",
      "suited for midday work and others for evening work. Sometimes there is a\r\n",

      "More than two thousand years ago the first men of science, the Greeks of\r\n",

      "grind a piece of stone into dust. You can divide a spoonful of water\r\n",

      "ultimately composed of minute particles which were indivisible. That is\r\n",
      "the meaning of the Greek word \"atom.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Like so many other ideas of these brilliant early Greek thinkers, the\r\n",
      "atom was a sound conception. We know to-day that matter is composed of\r\n",
      "atoms. But science was then so young that the way in which the Greeks\r\n",
      "applied the idea was not very profound. A liquid or a gas, they said,\r\n",
      "consisted of round, smooth atoms, which would not cling together. Then\r\n",
      "there were atoms with rough surfaces, \"hooky\" surfaces, and these stuck\r\n",
      "together and formed solids. The atoms of iron or marble, for instance,\r\n",
      "were so very hooky that, once they got together, a strong man could not\r\n",
      "tear them apart. The Greeks thought that the explanation of the universe\r\n",
      "was that an infinite number of these atoms had been moving and mixing in\r\n",
      "an infinite space during an infinite time, and had at last hit by chance\r\n",

      "a scientific hypothesis. The whole physical and chemical science of that\r\n",
      "century was now based upon the atom, and it is quite a mistake to\r\n",
      "suppose that recent discoveries have discredited \"atomism.\" An atom is\r\n",
      "the smallest particle of a chemical element. No one has ever seen an\r\n",

      "the hands of Sir George H. Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin, the tides\r\n",

      "system formed by our earth and moon. It is quite certain that, long ages\r\n",
      "ago, the earth was rotating immensely faster than it is now, and that\r\n",
      "the moon was so near as to be actually in contact with the earth. In\r\n",

      "two pieces; one piece became the earth we now know, and the other became\r\n",
      "the moon. Such is the conclusion to which we are led by an examination\r\n",
      "of the tides. In the first place let us consider the energy produced by\r\n",
      "the tides. We see evidences of this energy all round the word's\r\n",
      "coastlines. Estuaries are scooped out, great rocks are gradually reduced\r\n",
      "to rubble, innumerable tons of matter are continually being set in\r\n",

      "rotation of the earth._ The massive bulk of the earth, turning every\r\n",
      "twenty-four hours on its axis, is like a gigantic flywheel. In virtue of\r\n",
      "its rotation it possesses an enormous store of energy. But even the\r\n",
      "heaviest and swiftest flywheel, if it is doing work, or even if it is\r\n",
      "only working against the friction of its bearings, cannot dispense\r\n",
      "energy for ever. It must, gradually, slow down. There is no escape from\r\n",
      "this reasoning. It is the rotation of the earth which supplies the\r\n",
      "energy of the tides, and, as a consequence, the tides must be slowing\r\n",
      "down the earth. The tides act as a kind of brake on the earth's\r\n",
      "rotation. These masses of water, _held back by the moon_, exert a kind\r\n",
      "of dragging effect on the rotating earth. Doubtless this effect,\r\n",
      "measured by our ordinary standards, is very small; it is, however,\r\n",
      "continuous, and in the course of the millions of years dealt with in\r\n",
      "astronomy, this small but constant effect may produce very considerable\r\n",
      "results.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But there is another effect which can be shown to be a necessary\r\n",
      "mathematical consequence of tidal action. It is the moon's action on the\r\n",
      "earth which produces the tides, but they also react on the moon. The\r\n",
      "tides are slowing down the earth, and they are also driving the moon\r\n",
      "farther and farther away. This result, strange as it may seem, does not\r\n",
      "permit of doubt, for it is the result of an indubitable dynamical\r\n",
      "principle, which cannot be made clear without a mathematical discussion.\r\n",
      "Some interesting consequences follow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Since the earth is slowing down, it follows that it was once rotating\r\n",
      "faster. There was a period, a long time ago, when the day comprised only\r\n",
      "twenty hours. Going farther back still we come to a day of ten hours,\r\n",

      "three or four hours, we find that the moon was so near as to be almost\r\n",

      "beyond which the flywheel would fly into pieces because the centrifugal\r\n",
      "force developed is so great as to overcome the cohesion of the molecules\r\n",

      "immense velocity. We have also seen that, at that moment, the moon was\r\n",

      "similar to that which would be adopted by the insect. Suppose, for\r\n",

      "near its edge, or possibly outside it altogether, lies the great series\r\n",
      "of star clouds which make up the Milky Way. All the stars are in motion\r\n",
      "within this system, but the very remarkable discovery has been made that\r\n",
      "these motions are not entirely random. The great majority of the stars\r\n",
      "whose motions can be measured fall into two groups drifting past one\r\n",
      "another in opposite directions. The velocity of one stream relative to\r\n",

      "one stream there are three in the other. Now, as we have said, some\r\n",
      "eminent astronomers hold that the spiral nebulæ are universes like our\r\n",
      "own, and if we look at the two photographs (Figs. 25 and 26) we see that\r\n",
      "these spirals present features which, in the light of what we have just\r\n",
      "said about our system, are very remarkable. The nebula in Coma Berenices\r\n",
      "is a spiral edge-on to us, and we see that it has precisely the\r\n",
      "lens-shaped middle and the general flattened shape that we have found in\r\n",
      "our own system. The nebula in Canes Venatici is a spiral facing towards\r\n",
      "us, and its shape irresistibly suggests motions along the spiral arms.\r\n",
      "This motion, whether it is towards or away from the central, lens-shaped\r\n",
      "portion, would cause a double streaming motion in that central portion\r\n",
      "of the kind we have found in our own system. Again, and altogether apart\r\n",
      "from these considerations, there are good reasons for supposing our\r\n",
      "Milky Way to possess a double-armed spiral structure. And the great\r\n",
      "patches of dark absorbing matter which are known to exist in the Milky\r\n",
      "Way (see Fig. 22) would give very much the mottled appearance we notice\r\n",
      "in the arms (which we see edge-on) of the nebula in Coma Berenices. The\r\n",
      "hypothesis, therefore, that our universe is a spiral nebula has much to\r\n",
      "be said for it. If it be accepted it greatly increases our estimate of\r\n",

      "belongs was from its first divergence arboreal. He maintains that the\r\n",
      "leading peculiarities of the immediate precursors of man were wrought\r\n",
      "out during a long arboreal apprenticeship. The first great gain of\r\n",
      "arboreal life on bipedal erect lines (not after the quadrupedal fashion\r\n",
      "of tree-sloths, for instance) was the emancipation of the hand. The\r\n",
      "foot became the supporting and branch-gripping member, and the hand was\r\n",
      "set free to reach upward, to hang on by, to seize the fruit, to lift it\r\n",
      "and hold it to the mouth, and to hug the young one close to the breast.\r\n",

      "other digits of the hand and foot--an obvious advantage for\r\n",
      "branch-gripping. But the evolution of a free hand made it possible to\r\n",
      "dispense with protrusive lips and gripping teeth. Thus began the\r\n",

      "they are clearly necessary for terse and precise scientific description.\r\n",
      "It is certain, however, that they can be reduced to a minimum without\r\n",
      "sacrificing accuracy, when the object in view is to explain \"the gist of\r\n",

      "who lacks both time and opportunity for special study, and yet would\r\n",
      "take an intelligent interest in the progress of science which is making\r\n",
      "the world always new.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story of the triumphs of modern science is one of which Man may well\r\n",
      "be proud. Science reads the secret of the distant star and anatomises\r\n",
      "the atom; foretells the date of the comet's return and predicts the\r\n",

      "The idea of Evolution has influenced all the sciences, forcing us to\r\n",
      "think of _everything_ as with a history behind it, for we have travelled\r\n",
      "far since Darwin's day. The solar system, the earth, the mountain\r\n",
      "ranges, and the great deeps, the rocks and crystals, the plants and\r\n",
      "animals, man himself and his social institutions--all must be seen as\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It is characteristic of modern science that the whole world is seen to\r\n",
      "be more vital than before. Everywhere there has been a passage from the\r\n",
      "static to the dynamic. Thus the new revelations of the constitution of\r\n",
      "matter, which we owe to the discoveries of men like Professor Sir J. J.\r\n",
      "Thomson, Professor Sir Ernest Rutherford, and Professor Frederick Soddy,\r\n",
      "have shown the very dust to have a complexity and an activity heretofore\r\n",

      "the spectroscope and other highly perfected scientific instruments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The advent of the electron theory has thrown a flood of light on what\r\n",

      "As in chemistry and physics, so in the science of living creatures there\r\n",
      "have been recent advances that have changed the whole prospect. A good\r\n",
      "instance is afforded by the discovery of the \"hormones,\" or chemical\r\n",

      "the supra-renal, and the pituitary, and are distributed throughout the\r\n",

      "may be called the \"pace\" of the body, and bring about that regulated\r\n",
      "harmony and smoothness of working which we know as health. It is not too\r\n",
      "much to say that the discovery of hormones has changed the whole of\r\n",

      "mastery. To a degree which has almost surpassed expectations there has\r\n",
      "been a revelation of the intricacy of the stones and mortar of the house\r\n",
      "of life, and the microscopic study of germ-cells has wonderfully\r\n",

      "different instruments are to be counted by the score, but there are two\r\n",

      "imperfect telescope of his own invention, first observed the spots on\r\n",
      "the sun, the mountains of the moon, and the chief four satellites of\r\n",

      "that primitive instrument to the modern giant recently erected on Mount\r\n",

      "early instruments have only an historic interest: the era of modern\r\n",
      "telescopes begins in the nineteenth century.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During the last century telescope construction underwent an\r\n",
      "unprecedented development. An immense amount of interest was taken in\r\n",
      "the construction of large telescopes, and the different countries of the\r\n",
      "world entered on an exciting race to produce the most powerful possible\r\n",
      "instruments. Besides this rivalry of different countries there was a\r\n",
      "rivalry of methods. The telescope developed along two different lines,\r\n",
      "and each of these two types has its partisans at the present day. These\r\n",
      "types are known as _refractors_ and _reflectors_, and it is necessary to\r\n",
      "mention, briefly, the principles employed in each. The _refractor_ is\r\n",
      "the ordinary, familiar type of telescope. It consists, essentially, of a\r\n",
      "large lens at one end of a tube, and a small lens, called the eye-piece,\r\n",
      "at the other. The function of the large lens is to act as a sort of\r\n",
      "gigantic eye. It collects a large amount of light, an amount\r\n",
      "proportional to its size, and brings this light to a focus within the\r\n",
      "tube of the telescope. It thus produces a small but bright image, and\r\n",
      "the eye-piece magnifies this image. In the _reflector_, instead of a\r\n",
      "large lens at the top of the tube, a large mirror is placed at the\r\n",
      "bottom. This mirror is so shaped as to reflect the light that falls on\r\n",
      "it to a focus, whence the light is again led to an eye-piece. Thus the\r\n",
      "refractor and the reflector differ chiefly in their manner of gathering\r\n",
      "light. The powerfulness of the telescope depends on the size of the\r\n",
      "light-gatherer. A telescope with a lens four inches in diameter is four\r\n",
      "times as powerful as the one with a lens two inches in diameter, for the\r\n",
      "amount of light gathered obviously depends on the _area_ of the lens,\r\n",
      "and the area varies as the _square_ of the diameter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The largest telescopes at present in existence are _reflectors_. It is\r\n",
      "much easier to construct a very large mirror than to construct a very\r\n",
      "large lens; it is also cheaper. A mirror is more likely to get out of\r\n",
      "order than is a lens, however, and any irregularity in the shape of a\r\n",
      "mirror produces a greater distorting effect than in a lens. A refractor\r\n",
      "is also more convenient to handle than is a reflector. For these reasons\r\n",
      "great refractors are still made, but the largest of them, the great\r\n",

      "the simplest form of this instrument the analysing portion consists of a\r\n",
      "single prism. Unless the prism is very large, however, only a small\r\n",

      "accurate analytical work, that the dispersion--that is, the separation\r\n",
      "of the different parts of the spectrum--should be as great as possible.\r\n",
      "The dispersion can be increased by using a large number of prisms, the\r\n",
      "light emerging from the first prism, entering the second, and so on. In\r\n",
      "this way each prism produces its own dispersive effect and, when a\r\n",

      "animals (Protozoa and Metazoa). But the gulf was bridged very long ago\r\n",
      "when sponges, stinging animals, and simple worms were evolved, and\r\n",
      "showed, for the first time, a \"body.\" What would one not give to be able\r\n",
      "to account for the making of a body, one of the great steps in\r\n",
      "evolution! No one knows, but the problem is not altogether obscure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When an ordinary Protozoon or one-celled animal divides into two or\r\n",
      "more, which is its way of multiplying, the daughter-units thus formed\r\n",

      "which the daughter-units are not quite separated off from one another,\r\n",
      "but remain coherent. Thus Volvox, a beautiful green ball, found in some\r\n",
      "canals and the like, is a colony of a thousand or even ten thousand\r\n",
      "cells. It has almost formed a body! But in this \"colony-making\"\r\n",
      "Protozoon, and in others like it, the component cells are all of one\r\n",

      "It was possibly in some such way that animals and plants with a body\r\n",

      "For the body of a many-celled Wheel Animalcule or Rotifer is no bigger\r\n",

      "nine hundred odd cells, whereas the Protozoon has only one, except in\r\n",
      "forms like Volvox. Secondly, it is a luminous fact that _every\r\n",
      "many-celled animal from sponge to man that multiplies in the ordinary\r\n",
      "way begins at the beginning again as a \"single cell,\"_ the fertilised\r\n",

      "many-celled creature, reproduced in the ordinary way and not by budding\r\n",
      "or the like, starts as a fertilised egg-cell. The coherence of the\r\n",
