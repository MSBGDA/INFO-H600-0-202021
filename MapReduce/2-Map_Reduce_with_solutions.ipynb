    "####  This pratical session will approach the concept of Map Reduce programming model through simple examples. We will focus on writting a simple WordCount program in Map Reduce using Python that we will run locally without relying on the Hadoop back-end so that it becomes clear \"Map Reduce\" simply is a programming model that is merely implemented in Hadoop.  It should be kept in mind however, as can be seen in figure hereunder, that our local approach does not make use of any parallelisation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Word Count is kind of the canonical example used to illustrate the Map Reduce programming model. The idea is to simply count the number each word's appearance through a given set of input texts.\n",

    "#### What does the Mapper do ?\n",
    "One mapper takes a line (i.e: a string of text) as input and must break it into words. Then, it outputs the key/value pairs it computed for the line received as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What does the Reducer do ?\n",
    "One reducer receives key/value pairs as input and counts, for each word the total and output the final result for a single record.\n",

    "Fine, **BUT** what about **Shuffle and Sort** ?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Shuffle phase :** Transfer of the map output from **a** Mapper to **a** Reducer in MapReduce\n",
    "* **Sort phase :** Merging and sorting of map outputs. Data from the mapper are grouped by the key and automatically split among the reducers, whatever their number, and sorted by key.\n",

    "Also, Sorting is done by Key not by Value !\n",

GroupLens Research has collected and made available rating data sets from the MovieLens web site for the purpose of research into making recommendation services. In this exercise, we will use one of these datasets (the movielens 10M dataset, http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m-README.html) and compute some basic queries on it.\n",

    ">_Hint_: To answer this query, you will need to combine information from two different files. In python, it is not possible to run two different map functions on two different files inside the same Map/Reduce job. To circumvent this, you will need to answer this query by running **three** Map/Reduce jobs consecutively. The first two jobs convert movies.dat and rating.dat into a common structure. This common structure is then processed by the third job, which computes the actual result. Defining exactly what this common structure is, is part of the exercise.\n",
